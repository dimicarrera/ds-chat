# Chat App

A chat application using React, Redux Toolkit, Socket.io, and Tailwind CSS.
## Setup

### Install dependencies

Install the dependencies for the client and server.

```bash
# in one terminal window
cd server && yarn
# in another terminal window
cd client && yarn
```

### Start server

An Express server is maintaining a Socket.io connection, persisting data short-term in memory, and exposes an API for accessing persistent data.

```bash
# in /server
yarn start
```

> Server is running on `localhost:5000`.

### Start client

A React-Redux server for the front-end.

```bash
# in /client
yarn start
```

> Client server is running on `localhost:3000`.

You can view the app at `localhost:3000`. Log in with any valid email and username, and you'll enter into the general chatroom, which will display all users (also listing which are currently online) and all messages.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
